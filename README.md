This project is an attempt to provide a H5BP based theme for [Hugo][], which is
a super speedy and seemingly nifty static site generator.

The baseline is H5BP, along with some fairly minimal personal choices for
markup, nothing fancy. It's all also going to be easily overriden by users of
the theme. It won't provide a whole heck of a lot, aside from a very basic
baseline that should prove to be a friendly site for a wide variety of modern
devices.
